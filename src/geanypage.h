/* GeanyPage, a container widget with auxiliary data that is needed to display the containts
 * in GtkNobtebookds. The auxiliary data includes a label and icon as well as a complete tab
 * widget that should packed into the tab widgets (along with the close button).
 *
 * As such, GeanyPage separates GeanyDocument and our GtkNotebook logic, so that notebook.c
 * doesn't know it displays GeanyDocuments/Scintillas and document.c isn't concerned with how
 * to draw the current document.
 *
 * GeanyPage is currently specialized for this and therefore quite bad at being general purpose.
 * However, the widget hierarchy below GeanyPage can ba arbitrary, as long as there is a designated
 * focus widget (use gtk_container_set_focus_widget()).
