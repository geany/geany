These files are from the Scintilla project, http://www.scintilla.org.

See License.txt for the Scintilla license.

We try to keep these files in sync with the official project; any
changes should be sent there first. Otherwise changes could cause
conflicts when we next update Scintilla.


Public header constants (include/*.h)
-------------------------------------
You should not add constants in header files - instead use
Scintilla.iface and HFacer.py.

Do not change the value of constants in header files as this will
break Scintilla's ABI.
