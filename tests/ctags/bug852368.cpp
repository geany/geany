Summary: c/c++ unabalanced template brackets in signature

Initial Comment:
hi,

ctags 5.5x generates unbalanced template brackets in 
the  method/function signature if a function parameter 
is a template.

i.e.
*/
void foo(std::vector<float> &);
/*
generates the following signature
signature:void (std::vector<<float>&)

let me know if you need more details.

regards
cider
*/
