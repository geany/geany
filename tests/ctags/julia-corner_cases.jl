## Simple function definitions.
# Expected: `function` should be highlighted, as should `foo_bar!`.
function foo_bar!(x,y)
    x + y + 1
end

# Expected: `foo_bar!` should be highlighted.
foo_bar!(x,y) = x + y

# Expected: `foo` should be highlighted.
Baz.foo(x) = 1

# Expected: `foo` should be highlighted.
foo(x::(Int,)) = 1

# Expected: `foo` should be highlighted.
foo(x, y=length(x))

## Function definitions in namespaces.
# Expected: `bar` should be highlighted.
function Foo.bar(x, y)
    x + 1
end

## Function definitions with type variables.
# Expected: `elsize` should be highlighted.
elsize(::AbstractArray{T}) where {T} = sizeof(T)

function elsize(::AbstractArray{T}) where T
    sizeof(T)
end

## Nested brackets in function definitions.
# Expected: `cell` should be highlighted.
cell(dims::(Integer...)) = Array(Any, convert((Int...), dims))

# TODO: find an example with a nested type expression.

## Macro usage
# Expected: `@hello_world!` should be highlighted.
@hello_world! foo

# Expected: highlight `myfun`
@inline myfun() = println("myfun")

## Builtin functions.
# Expected: `throw`, `error` and `super` should not be highlighted. There are
# too many built-in functions for this to be useful.
