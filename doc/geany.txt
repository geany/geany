Chapter 1. Introduction

1.1. About Geany

   Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development
   Environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE,
   which has only a few dependencies from other packages. Another
   goal was to be as independent as possible from a special
   Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME, so Geany only requires
   the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you only need the GTK2 runtime
   libraries installed to run it.

   The basic features of Geany are:

     * Syntax highlighting
     * Code completion
     * Auto completion of often used constructs like if, for and
       while
     * Auto completion of XML and HTML tags
     * Call tips
     * Many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python,
       Perl, Pascal
     * Tag/Symbol lists
     _________________________________________________________

1.2. About this document

   This documentation is available in various formats like HTML,
   text and PDF. The latest version is always available at
   http://geany.uvena.de.
     _________________________________________________________

1.3. Where to get it

   You can obtain Geany from http://geany.uvena.de or perhaps
   from your distributor.
     _________________________________________________________

1.4. License

   Geany is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
   License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
   version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
   version. A copy of this license can be found in the file
   COPYING included with the source code of this program or see
   Appendix B.

   The included Scintilla library (found in the subdirectory
   scintilla/) has its own license, which can be found in the
   appendix (see Appendix C).
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Installation

2.1. Requirements

   For compiling Geany yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0)
   libraries and header files. You will also need the Pango, Glib
   and ATK libraries and header files. All these files are
   available at http://www.gtk.org.

   Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make
   tool; a C++ compiler is also required for the included
   Scintilla library. The GNU versions of these tools are
   recommended.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2. Source compilation

   Compiling Geany is quite easy. The following should do it:
                                        % ./configure
                                        % make
                                        % make install

   The configure script supports several common options, for a
   detailed list, type
                                        % ./configure --help

   In the case that your system lacks dynamic linking loader
   support, you probably want to pass the option --disable-vte to
   the configure script. This prevents compiling Geany with
   dynamic linking loader support to automatically load
   libvte.so.4 if available.

   Geany has been successfully compiled and tested under Debian
   3.1 Sarge, Debian 3.2 Etch, Fedora Core 4, LinuxFromScratch
   and FreeBSD 6.0. It also compiles under Microsoft Windows(TM),
   but there are lots of changes to the makefiles necessary.

   If there are any errors during compilation, check your build
   environment and try to find the error, otherwise contact the
   author at <enrico.troeger@uvena.de>.
     _________________________________________________________

2.3. Binary packages

2.3.1. Fedora

   You can use the Fedora Core 4 repository from
   http://naturidentisch.de/packages/fc4/.

   You can also use the Fedora Core 5 repository from
   http://naturidentisch.de/packages/fc5/.
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.2. Debian

   Geany is available through the official Debian archives.

   apt-get install geany
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.3. SuSE

   Packages for SuSE are not yet available.
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.4. Gentoo

   An ebuild for Gentoo can be found on http://bugs.gentoo.de.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Usage

3.1. Getting started

   You can start Geany in the following ways:

     * From the Desktop Environment menu
       Choose in your application menu of your used Desktop
       Environment: Development->Geany.
     * From the command line
       To start Geany from a command line, type the following and
       press Return:
                                                                % geany
     _________________________________________________________

3.2. Command line options

   Table 3-1. Command line Options
   Short option Long option Function
   -s --no-session Don't load the previous session's files.
   -n --no-ctags Do not load auto completion and call tip data.
   Use this option if you do not want to use them.
   -m --no-msgwin Do not show the message window. Use this option
   if you do not need compiler messages or VTE support.
   -i --new-instance Do not open files in a running instance,
   force opening a new instance.
   -t --no-terminal Do not load terminal support. Use this option
   if you do not want to load the virtual terminal emulator
   widget at startup. If you do not have libvte.so.4 installed,
   then terminal-support is automatically disabled.
   -l --vte-lib Specify explicitly the path including filename or
   only the filename to the VTE library, e.g. /usr/lib/libvte.so
   or libvte.so. This option is only needed when the
   autodetection does not work.
   -c directory_name --config=directory_name Use an alternate
   configuration directory. Default configuration directory is
   ~/.geany/ and there resides geany.conf and other configuration
   files.
   -d --debug Run Geany in debug mode, which means being verbose
   and printing lots of information.
   -? --help Show help information and exit.
   -v --version Show version information and exit.
     [files ...] Open all given files at startup. This option
   causes Geany to ignore loading stored files from the last
   session (if enabled).
   Geany supports all generic GTK options, a list is available on
   the help screen.
     _________________________________________________________

3.3. General

3.3.1. Startup

   At startup, Geany loads the first 15 files from the last time
   Geany was launched. You can disable this feature in the
   preferences dialog(see Figure 3-2). If you specify some files
   on the command line, only these files will be opened, but you
   can find the files from the last session in the file menu
   under the "Recent files" item. This contains the last 15
   recently opened files. It may be that Geany loads not exactly
   15 session files, this depends on the compile time option
   GEANY_SESSION_FILES; the default is 15. For details see
   Section 3.6.1.

   You can start several instances of Geany, but only the first
   will load files from the last session. To run a second
   instance of Geany, do not specify any filenames on the
   command-line, or disable opening files in a running instance
   using the appropriate command line option.
     _________________________________________________________

3.3.2. Opening files from the command-line in a running instance

   Geany detects an already running instance of itself and opens
   files from the command-line in the already running instance.
   So, Geany can be used to view and edit files by opening them
   from other programs such as a file manager. If you do not like
   this for some reason, you can disable using the first instance
   by using the appropriate command line option - see Section
   3.2.
     _________________________________________________________

3.3.3. Virtual terminal emulator widget (VTE)

   If you have installed libvte.so in your system, it is loaded
   automatically by Geany, and you will have a terminal widget in
   the notebook at the bottom.

   If Geany cannot find libvte.so at startup, the terminal widget
   will not be loaded. So there is no need to install the package
   containing this file in order to run Geany. Additionally, you
   can disable the use of the terminal widget by command line
   option, for more information see Section 3.2.

   You can use this terminal (from now on called VTE) nearly as
   an usual terminal program like xterm. There is basic clipboard
   support. You can paste the contents of the clipboard by
   pressing the right mouse button to open the popup menu and
   choosing Paste. To copy text from the VTE, just select the
   desired text and then press the right mouse button and choose
   Copy from the popup menu. On systems running the X Window
   System you can paste the last selected text by pressing the
   middle mouse button in the VTE (on 2-button mice, the middle
   button can often be simulated by pressing both mouse buttons
   together).

   Note

   Geany tries to load libvte.so. If this fails, it tries to load
   libvte.so.4. If this fails too, you should check whether you
   installed libvte correctly. Again, Geany also runs without
   this library.

   It could be, that the library is called something else than
   libvte.so.4 (e.g. on FreeBSD 6.0 it is called libvte.so.8). So
   please set a link to the correct file (as root).
# ln -s /usr/lib/libvte.so.X /usr/lib/libvte.so.4

   Obviously, you have to adjust the paths and set X to the
   number of your libvte.so.
     _________________________________________________________

3.4. Character sets and Unicode Byte-Order-Mark (BOM)

   Geany provides support for detecting and converting character
   sets. So you can open and save files in different character
   sets and even can convert a file from a character set to
   another one. To do this, Geany uses the character conversion
   capabilities of the GLib.

   Furthermore, Geany detects an Unicode Byte Order Mark (see
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark for details). Of
   course, this feature is only available if the opened file is
   in an unicode encoding. The Byte Order Mark helps to detect
   the encoding of a file, e.g. whether it is UTF-16LE or
   UTF-16BE and so on. On Unix-like systems using a Byte Order
   Mark could cause some problems, e.g. the gcc stops with stray
   errors, PHP does not parse a script containing a BOM and
   script files starting with a she-bang maybe cannot be started.
   In the status bar you can easily see whether the file starts
   with a BOM or not. If you want to set a BOM for a file or if
   you want to remove it from a file, just use the document menu
   and toggle the checkbox.

   Note

   If you are unsure what a BOM is or if you do not understand
   where to use it, then it is not important for you and you can
   safely ignore it.
     _________________________________________________________

3.5. Search, replace and go to

   This section describes search-related commands from the Search
   menu and the editor window's popup menu:

     * Find
     * Find usage *
     * Find in files
     * Replace
     * Go to tag definition *
     * Go to tag declaration *
     * Go to line

   * These items are available from the editor window's popup
   menu, or by using a keyboard shortcut (see Section 3.9).
     _________________________________________________________

3.5.1. Find

   The Find dialog is used for finding text within the current
   document. The syntax for the "Use regular expressions" option
   is shown in Table 3-2.

   Figure 3-1. Find dialog

   [find_dialog.jpg]
     _________________________________________________________

3.5.2. Find usage

   Find usage searches all open files. If there is a selection,
   then it is used as the search text; otherwise the current word
   is used. The current word is either taken from the word
   nearest the edit cursor, or the word underneath the popup menu
   click position when the popup menu is used. The search results
   are shown in the Messages window.
     _________________________________________________________

3.5.3. Find in files

   Find in files is a more powerful version of Find usage that
   searches all files in a certain directory using the Grep tool.
   The Grep tool must be correctly set in Preferences to the path
   of the system's Grep utility.
     _________________________________________________________

3.5.4. Replace

   The Replace dialog has the same options for finding text as
   the Find dialog. There is also a "Replace in all files"
   option, which is used with the Replace All button to perform
   the replacement for all open files.

   The "Use regular expressions" option applies both to the
   search string and to the replacement text; for the latter back
   references can be used - see the entry for '\n' in Table 3-2.
     _________________________________________________________

3.5.5. Go to tag definition

   If the current word is the name of a function and the file
   containing the function definition (a.k.a. function body) is
   open, Go to tag definition will switch to that file and go to
   the corresponding line number. The current word is either
   taken from the word nearest the edit cursor, or the word
   underneath the popup menu click position when the popup menu
   is used.
     _________________________________________________________

3.5.6. Go to tag declaration

   Like Go to tag definition, but for a forward function
   declaration (a.k.a. function prototype) instead of a function
   definition.
     _________________________________________________________

3.5.7. Go to line

   Go to a particular line number in the current file.
     _________________________________________________________

3.5.8. Regular expressions

   You can use regular expressions in the Find and Replace
   dialogs by selecting the "Use regular expressions" check box.
   The syntax is POSIX-like, as described below in Table 3-2.

   Note

   Searching backwards with regular expressions is not supported.

   Table 3-2. Regular expressions
   In a regular expression, the following characters are
   interpreted:
   . Matches any character.
   ( This marks the start of a region for tagging a match.
   ) This marks the end of a tagged region.
   \n Where n is 1 through 9 refers to the first through ninth
   tagged region when replacing. For example, if the search
   string was Fred([1-9])XXX and the replace string was Sam\1YYY,
   when applied to Fred2XXX this would generate Sam2YYY.
   \< This matches the start of a word.
   \> This matches the end of a word.
   \x This allows you to use a character x that would otherwise
   have a special meaning. For example, \[ would be interpreted
   as [ and not as the start of a character set. Use \\ for a
   literal backslash.
   [...] This indicates a set of characters, for example, [abc]
   means any of the characters a, b or c. You can also use
   ranges, for example [a-z] for any lower case character.
   [^...] The complement of the characters in the set. For
   example, [^A-Za-z] means any character except an alphabetic
   character.
   ^ This matches the start of a line (unless used inside a set,
   see above).
   $ This matches the end of a line.
   * This matches 0 or more times. For example, Sa*m matches Sm,
   Sam, Saam, Saaam and so on.
   + This matches 1 or more times. For example, Sa+m matches Sam,
   Saam, Saaam and so on.

   Note Partial POSIX compatibility


   Note that the POSIX '?' regular expression character for
   optional matching is not supported by the Find and Replace
   dialogs.

     _________________________________________________________

3.6.1. Compile time options

   There are some options which can only be changed at compile
   time. To change these options, edit the file src/geany.h. Look
   for a block of lines starting with "#define GEANY_*". Any
   definitions which are not listed here should not be changed.

   Table 3-3. Compile time options
   Option Description Default
   GEANY_MAX_OPEN_FILES The limit to how many files can be open
   at the same time. 25
   GEANY_SESSION_FILES How many files should be reopened from the
   last run. Obviously, the value should be smaller than
   GEANY_MAX_OPEN_FILES. 15
   GEANY_WORDCHARS These characters define word boundaries. (look
   at sourcecode)
   GEANY_MAX_AUTOCOMPLETE_WORDS How many auto completion
   suggestions should Geany provide. 30
   GEANY_STRING_UNTITLED A string used as the default name for
   new files. Be aware that the string can be translated, so
   change it only if you know what you are doing. untitled
   GEANY_CHECK_FILE_DELAY Time in seconds between checking a file
   for external changes. 30
   GEANY_WINDOW_MINIMAL_WIDTH The minimal width of the main
   window. 620
   GEANY_WINDOW_MINIMAL_HEIGHT The minimal height of the main
   window. 440
   GEANY_WINDOW_DEFAULT_WIDTH The default width of the main
   window at the first start. 900
   GEANY_WINDOW_DEFAULT_HEIGHT The default height of the main
   window at the first start. 600
   Default values
   GEANY_DEFAULT_TOOLS_MAKE The make tool. This can also include
   a path. "make"
   GEANY_DEFAULT_TOOLS_TERMINAL A terminal emulator. It has to
   accept the command line option "-e". This can also include a
   path. "xterm"
   GEANY_DEFAULT_TOOLS_BROWSER A web browser. This can also
   include a path. "mozilla"
   GEANY_DEFAULT_TOOLS_PRINTCMD A printing tool. It should be
   able to accept and process plain text files. This can also
   include a path. "lpr"
   GEANY_DEFAULT_TOOLS_GREP A grep tool. It should be compatible
   with GNU grep. This can also include a path. "grep"
   GEANY_DEFAULT_MRU_LENGHTH The length of the "Recent files"
   list. "10"
   GEANY_DEFAULT_FONT_SYMBOL_LIST The font used in sidebar to
   show symbols and open files. "Cursor 8"
   GEANY_DEFAULT_FONT_MSG_WINDOW The font used in the messages
   window. "Cursor 8"
   GEANY_DEFAULT_FONT_EDITOR The font used in the editor window.
   "Courier New 9"
     _________________________________________________________

3.7. Build system

   Geany has an integrated build system. Firstly this means that
   the current source file will be saved before it is processed.
   This is for convenience so that you don't need to keep saving
   small changes to the current file before building.

   Secondly the output for Compile, Build and Make actions will
   be captured in the Compiler notebook tab of the messages
   window (assuming you have it visible). If there are any
   warnings or errors with line numbers shown in the Compiler
   output tab, you can double click on them and Geany will switch
   to the relevant source file (if it is open) and mark the line
   number so the problem can be corrected. Geany will also set
   indicators for warnings or errors with line numbers.

   Depending on the current file's filetype, the Build menu will
   contain the following items:

     * Compile
     * Build
     * Make all
     * Make custom target
     * Make object
     * Execute
     * Set Includes and Arguments
     _________________________________________________________

3.7.1. Compile

   The Compile command has different uses for different kinds of
   files.

   For compilable languages such as C and C++, the Compile
   command is setup to compile the current source file into a
   binary object file.

   Java source files will be compiled to class file bytecode.
   Interpreted languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby will compile
   to bytecode if the language supports it, or will run a syntax
   check, or failing that will run the file in its language
   interpreter.
     _________________________________________________________

3.7.2. Build

   For compilable languages such as C and C++, the Build command
   will link the current source file's equivalent object file
   into an executable. If the object file does not exist, the
   source will be compiled and linked in one step, producing just
   the executable binary.

   Interpreted languages do not use the Build command.
     _________________________________________________________

3.7.3. Make all

   This effectively runs "make all" in the same directory as the
   current file.

   Note

   For each of the Make commands, The Make tool path must be
   correctly set in the Tools tab of the Preferences dialog.
     _________________________________________________________

3.7.4. Make custom target

   This is similar to running 'Make all' but you will be prompted
   for the make target name to be passed to the Make tool. For
   example, typing 'clean' in the dialog prompt will run "make
   clean".
     _________________________________________________________

3.7.5. Make object

   Make object will run "make current_file.o" in the same
   directory as the current file, using its prefix for
   'current_file'. It is useful for compiling just the current
   file without building the whole project.
     _________________________________________________________

3.7.6. Execute

   Execute will run the corresponding executable file, shell
   script or interpreted script in a terminal window. Note that
   the Terminal tool path must be correctly set in the Tools tab
   of the Preferences dialog - you can use any terminal program
   that runs a Bourne compatible shell.

   After your program or script has finished executing, you will
   be prompted to press the return key. This allows you to review
   any text output from the program before the terminal window is
   closed.
     _________________________________________________________

3.7.7. Set Includes and Arguments

   By default the Compile and Build commands invoke the compiler
   and linker with only the basic arguments needed by all
   programs. Using Set Includes and Arguments you can add any
   include paths and compile flags for the compiler, any library
   names and paths for the linker, and any arguments you want to
   use when running Execute.

   Note

   If you are using the Build command to compile and link in one
   step, you will need to set both the compiler arguments and the
   linker arguments in the linker command setting.

   These settings are not saved when Geany is shut down. See
   below for how to set permanent arguments.

   If you need complex settings for your build system, or several
   different settings, then writing a Makefile and using the Make
   commands is recommended.
     _________________________________________________________

3.7.8. Indicators

   Indicators are red squiggly underlines which are used to
   highlight errors which occured while compiling the current
   file. So you can easily see where your code failed to compile.
   To remove the indicators, just click on "Remove all
   indicators" in the document file menu.

   If you do not like this feature, you can disable it in the
   preferences dialog.
     _________________________________________________________

3.7.9. File type configuration settings

   You can set the commands to run for compiling, building or
   executing by opening the relevant filetypes.* configuration
   file, and checking the [build_settings] section. See Section
   4.1 for more information.
     _________________________________________________________

3.8. Printing support

   Geany has basic printing support. This means you can print a
   file by passing the filename of the current file to a command
   which actually prints the file. However, the printed document
   contains no syntax highlighting. You can adjust the command to
   which the filename is passed in the preferences dialog. The
   default command is:
% lpr %f

   %f will be substituted by the filename of the current file.
   Geany will not show errors from the command itself, so you
   should make sure that it works before(e.g. by trying to
   execute it from the command line).

   A nicer example, which I prefer is:
% a2ps -1 --medium=A4 -o - %f | xfprint4

   But this depends on a2ps and xfprint4. As a replacement for
   xfprint4, gtklp or similar programs can be used.

   Note

   The printing support of Geany will be improved in the future.
   With GTK 2.10, better printing (including syntax highlighting)
   will be possible.
     _________________________________________________________

3.9. Keybindings

   Geany supports the default keyboard shortcuts for the
   Scintilla editing widget. For a list of these commands, see
   Appendix A. The Scintilla keyboard shortcuts will be
   overridden by any custom keybindings with the same keyboard
   shortcut.

   For all actions listed below you can define your own
   keybindings. Open the Preferences dialog, select the desired
   action and click on change. In the opening dialog you can
   press any key combination you want and it will be saved when
   you press OK. You can define only one key combination for one
   action.

   Some of the default key combinations cannot be changed, e.g.
   menu_new or menu_open. These are set by GTK and should be
   kept, but you can still add other key combinations for these
   actions. For example to execute menu_open by default Ctrl-O is
   set, but you can also define Alt-O, so that the file open
   dialog is shown by pressing either Ctrl-O or Alt-O.

   The following table lists all customizable keyboard shortcuts.

     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Configuration files

4.1. Filetype definition files

   All colour definitions and other filetype specific settings
   are stored in the filetype definition files. Those settings
   are colours for syntax highlighting, general settings like
   comment characters or word delimiter characters as well as
   compiler and linker settings.

   The system-wide configuration files can be found in
   $prefix/share/geany and are called filetypes.$ext, where
   $prefix is the path where Geany is installed (commonly
   /usr/local) and $ext is the name of the filetype. For every
   filetype there is a corresponding definition file. There is
   one exception: filetypes.common - this file is for general
   settings, which are not specific to a certain filetype. It is
   not recommended to edit the system-wide files, because they
   will be overridden when Geany is updated.

   To change the settings, copy a file from $prefix/share/geany
   to the subdirectory filedefs in your configuration directory
   (usually ~/.geany/).

   For example:
% cp /usr/local/share/geany/filetypes.c /home/username/.geany/filedefs/

   Then you can edit the file and the changes are also available
   after an update of Geany because they reside in your
   configuration directory. Alternatively, you can create a file
   ~/.geany/filedefs/filetypes.X and add only these settings you
   want to change. All missing settings will be read from the
   corresponding global definition file in $prefix/share/geany.
     _________________________________________________________

4.1.1. Format

4.1.1.1. [styling] Section

   In this section the colours for syntax highlighting are
   defined. The format is always:
   key=forground_colour;background_colour;bold;italic

   Colours have to be specified as RGB hex values prefixed by 0x.
   For example red is 0xff0000, blue is 0x0000ff. The values are
   case-insensitive, but it is a good idea to use small letters.
   Bold and italic are flags and should only be "true" or
   "false". If their value is something other than "true" or
   "false", "false" is assumed.
     _________________________________________________________

4.1.1.2. [keywords] Section

   This section contains keys for different keyword lists
   specific to the filetype. Some filetypes do not support
   keywords, so adding a new key will not work. You can only add
   or remove keywords to/from an existing list.

   Important

   The keywords list must be in one line without line ending
   characters.
     _________________________________________________________

4.1.1.3. [settings] Section

   Table 4-1. General settings
   Key Description Example
   wordchars Word delimiting characters. These characters define
   word boundaries. (look at sourcecode)
   comment_open A character or string which is used to comment
   code. If you want to use multiline comments, also set
   comment_close, otherwise leave it empty. comment_open=/*
   comment_close If multiline comments are used, this is the
   character or string to close the comment. comment_close=*/
   comment_use_indent Set this to false if a comment character or
   string should start at column 0 of a line. If set to true it
   uses any indentation of the line.

   Example 4-1. Comment indentation

   comment_use_indent=true would generate this if a line is
   commented (e.g. with Ctrl-D)
        #command_example();

   comment_use_indent=false would generate this if a line is
   commented (e.g. with Ctrl-D)
#command_example();

   Note

   This setting only works for single line comments.
   comment_use_indent=true
     _________________________________________________________

4.1.1.4. [build_settings] Section

   Table 4-2. Build settings
   Key Description Example
   compiler This item specifies the command to compile source
   code files. But it is also possible to use it with interpreted
   languages like Perl or Python. With these filetypes you can
   use this option as a kind of syntax parser, which sends output
   to the compiler message window.

   You should quote the filename to also support filenames with
   spaces. The following wildcards for filenames are available:

     * %f - complete filename without path
     * %e - filename without path and without extension

   compiler=gcc -Wall -c "%f"
   linker This item specifies the command to link the file. If
   the file is not already compiled, it will be compiled while
   linking. The -o option is automatically added by Geany. This
   item works well with GNU gcc, but may be problematic with
   other compilers (esp. with the linker). linker=gcc -Wall "%f"
   run_cmd Use this item to execute your file. It has to have
   been built already. Use the %e wildcard to have only the name
   of the executable (i.e. without extension) or use the %f
   wildcard if you need the complete filename, e.g. for shell
   scripts. run_cmd="./%e"
     _________________________________________________________

4.1.2. Special file filetypes.common

   There is a special filetype definition file called
   filetypes.common. This file defines some general
   non-filetype-specific settings.

   Table 4-3. General settings
   Key Description Example
   selection The style for colouring selected text. The format
   is:

     * Foreground colour
     * Background colour
     * Use foreground colour
     * Use background colour

   The colours are only set if the 3rd or 4th argument is true.
   When the colours are not overridden, the default is a dark
   grey background with syntax highlighted foreground text.
   selection=0xc0c0c0;0x00007F;true;true
   brace_good The style for brace highlighting when a matching
   brace was found. brace_good=0xff0000;0xFFFFFF;true;false
   brace_bad The style for brace highlighting when no matching
   brace was found. brace_bad=0x0000ff;0xFFFFFF;true;false
   caret The style for colouring the caret(the blinking cursor).
   Only the first argument is interpreted.
   caret=0x000000;0x0;false;false
   current_line The style for colouring the background of the
   current line. Only the second argument is interpreted.
   current_line=0x0;0xe5e5e5;false;false
   indent_guide The style for colouring the indentation guides.
   Only the first and second arguments are interpreted.
   indent_guide=0xc0c0c0;0xffffff;false;false
   white_space The style for colouring the white space if it is
   shown. The first both arguments define the foreground and
   background colours, the third argument sets whether to use the
   defined colours or to use the colours defined by each filetype
   for the white space. white_space=0xc0c0c0;0xffffff;true;false
   folding_style The style of folding icons. Only first and
   second arguments are used.

   Valid values for the first argument are:

     * 1 - for boxes
     * 2 - for circles

   Valid values for the second argument are:

     * 1 - for straight lines
     * 2 - for curved lines

   folding_style=1;1;false;false
   invert_all Whether to invert all defined colours. This is
   useful if you like a dark background colour(e.g. black) and do
   not want to change every single line. Please note, at time of
   writing this was only tested with the C syntax highlighting.

   Only first argument is interpreted. Set it to 1 to invert all
   colours.
   invert_all=0;0;false;false
     _________________________________________________________

4.2. Filetype extensions

   You can override the default extensions that Geany uses for
   each filetype using the filetype_extensions.conf file.

   To override the system-wide configuration file, copy it from
   $prefix/share/geany to your configuration directory, usually
   ~/.geany/. $prefix is the path where Geany is installed
   (commonly /usr/local).

   For example:
% cp /usr/local/share/geany/filetype_extensions.conf /home/username/.ge
any/

   Then edit it and remove all the lines for filetype extensions
   that you do not want to override. The remaining lines can be
   edited after the = sign, using a semi-colon separated list of
   patterns which should be matched for that filetype.

   For example, to set the filetype extensions for Make, the
   /home/username/.geany/filetype_extensions.conf file should
   look like:

   [Extensions] Make=Makefile*;*.mk;Buildfile;
     _________________________________________________________

4.3. Templates

   Geany supports several templates for file headers, multiline
   comments (frame comments), function descriptions, a typical
   ChangeLog entry and a short GPL notice. To use these
   templates, just open the Edit menu or open the popup menu by
   right-clicking in the editor widget, and choose "Insert
   Comments" and insert templates as you want.

   Some templates (like file header or ChangeLog entry) will
   always be inserted at the top of the file.

   To insert a function description, the cursor must be inside of
   the function, so that the function name can be determined
   automatically. The description will be positioned correctly
   one line above the function, just check it out. If the cursor
   is not inside of a function or the function name cannot be
   determined, you cannot insert a function description.

   Each template can be customized to your needs. The templates
   are in the configuration directory, which is in ~/.geany/ (see
   Section 3.2 for further information about the configuration
   directory). Just open the desired template with an editor
   (ideally Geany ;-) ) and edit the template as your needs.
   There are some wildcards which will be automatically replaced
   by Geany at startup.

   All wildcards must be enclosed by "{" and "}", e.g. {date}.

   In the configuration dialog you can find a tab "Templates"
   (see Figure 3-7). You can define the default values which will
   be inserted in the templates. You should restart Geany after
   making changes, because they are only read at startup.

   Since Geany 0.3 there are also templates for creating new
   files. They can be found in ~/.geany/, too. All template files
   for creating new files begin with template.filetype. followed
   by the filetype. At creating a new file with a filetype
   template, the template for the fileheader is automatically
   prepended. Please note that the complete behaviour is still
   under development and will probably be changed in one of the
   next releases. Sorry.


   Table 4-4. Template wildcards
   Wildcard Description Available in following templates
   developer The name of the developer. filetypes, file header,
   function description, ChangeLog entry
   initial The developer's initials, e.g. "ET" for Enrico Tr√∂ger
   or "JFD" for John Foobar Doe. filetypes, file header, function
   description, ChangeLog entry
   mail The email address of the developer. file header, function
   description, ChangeLog entry
   company The company the developer is working for. filetypes,
   file header, function description, ChangeLog entry
   year The current year in the format: YYYY filetypes, file
   header, function description, ChangeLog entry
   version The initial version of a new file. filetypes, file
   header, function description, ChangeLog entry
   date The current date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD filetypes,
   file header, function description, ChangeLog entry

   your locale), used in filetype templates filetypes, file
   header, function description, ChangeLog entry
   geanyversion The actual Geany version, e.g. "Geany 0.9"
   filetypes, file header, function description, ChangeLog entry
   datetime The current date and time in the format: DD.MM.YYYY
   HH:mm:ss ZZZZ file header, function description
   filename The filename of the current file. Only available for
   the file header template. file header

   functionname The function name of the function at the cursor
   position. This wildcard will only be replaced in the function
   description template. function description
   If you need any other wildcards or a special date/time format,
   please email the author <enrico.troeger@uvena.de>.

Appendix A. Scintilla keyboard commands

A.1. Keyboard commands

   Keyboard commands for Scintilla mostly follow common Windows
   and GTK+ conventions. All move keys (arrows, page up/down,
   home and end) allows to extend or reduce the stream selection
   when holding the Shift key, and the rectangular selection when
   holding the Shift and Alt keys. Some keys may not be available
   with some national keyboards or because they are taken by the
   system such as by a window manager on GTK+. Keyboard
   equivalents of menu commands are listed in the menus. Some
   less common commands with no menu equivalent are:

Appendix B. GNU General Public License

B.1. Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
   freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
   Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
   and change free software - to make sure the software is free
   for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
   of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
   program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
   Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library
   General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
   programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
   not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
   sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
   software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
   receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can
   change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
   and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
   forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
   surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
   responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
   software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
   whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
   the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,
   receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
   these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps:

    1. copyright the software, and
    2. offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
       copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
   certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty
   for this free software. If the software is modified by someone
   else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
   they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
   by others will not reflect on the original authors'
   reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
   patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
   free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in
   effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we
   have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
   everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

B.2.1. Section 0

   This License applies to any program or other work which
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
   be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
   The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and
   a "work based on the Program " means either the Program or any
   derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
   with modifications and/or translated into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
   the term "modification ".) Each licensee is addressed as
   "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
   are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
   The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
   output from the Program is covered only if its contents
   constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
   been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
   depends on what the Program does.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.2. Section 1

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
   intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
   absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
   Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
   copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
   exchange for a fee.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.3. Section 2

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
   portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
   copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
   of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
   conditions:

    1. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
       notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
       any change.
    2. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
       that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
       Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at
       no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
       License.
    3. If the modified program normally reads commands
       interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
       running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
       to print or display an announcement including an
       appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
       warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
       that users may redistribute the program under these
       conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
       this License.

       Note Exception:


   If the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
   print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
   not required to print an announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
   Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
   separate works in themselves, then this License, and its
   terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them
   as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
   as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
   distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
   License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
   who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
   contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
   the intent is to exercise the right to control the
   distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
   Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
   Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
   on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
   the other work under the scope of this License.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.4. Section 3

   You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
   it, under Section 2 in object code or executable form under
   the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do
   one of the following:

    1. Accompany it with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
       under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
       customarily used for software interchange; or,
    2. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
       three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
       than your cost of physically performing source
       distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
       corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
       terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
       used for software interchange; or,
    3. Accompany it with the information you received as to the
       offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
       alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution
       and only if you received the program in object code or
       executable form with such an offer, in accord with
       Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
   work for making modifications to it. For an executable work,
   complete source code means all the source code for all modules
   it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
   plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
   of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally
   distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
   system on which the executable runs, unless that component
   itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by
   offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
   equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
   counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
   parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.5. Section 4

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
   Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
   the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your
   rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
   their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
   full compliance.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.6. Section 5

   You are not required to accept this License, since you have
   not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
   modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.
   These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
   License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program
   (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
   acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
   conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
   or works based on it.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.7. Section 6

   Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
   the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
   from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
   Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
   impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
   the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
   enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.8. Section 7

   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
   patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
   patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by
   court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
   conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
   conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
   any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
   not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
   Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
   through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
   this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of
   the Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or
   unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance
   of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole
   is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
   infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
   contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole
   purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
   distribution system, which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
   wide range of software distributed through that system in
   reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
   the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
   distribute software through any other system and a licensee
   cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
   believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.9. Section 8

   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
   interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
   Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
   distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
   distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
   limitation as if written in the body of this License.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.10. Section 9

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
   new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Program specifies a version number of this License which
   applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that version or
   of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
   of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.11. Section 10

   If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
   free programs whose distribution conditions are different,
   write to the author to ask for permission. For software which
   is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
   Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for
   this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
   software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
   generally.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.12. Section 11 NO WARRANTY

   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
   COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
   IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
   IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
   THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
     _________________________________________________________

B.2.13. Section 12

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
   MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
   LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
   INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
   SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
   TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
   OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
     _________________________________________________________

B.3. How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
   greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve
   this is to make it free software which everyone can
   redistribute and change under these terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
   safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
   effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
   should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to
   where the full notice is found.

   <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what
   it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
   modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
   useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
   warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
   License along with this program; if not, write to the Free
   Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,
   MA 02111-1307 USA

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
   paper mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice
   like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
   type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to
   redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for
   details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
   the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of
   course, the commands you use may be called something other
   than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or
   menu items--whatever suits your program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a
   programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
   disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample;
   alter the names:

   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers)
   written by James Hacker.

   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of
   Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
   program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
   subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
   linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is
   what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
   License instead of this License.
