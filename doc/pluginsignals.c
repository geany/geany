/**
 *  @file pluginsignals.c
 *  Plugin Signals
 *
 *
 *  @section Usage
 *
 *  To use plugin signals in Geany, you have two options:
 *
 *  -# Create a PluginCallback array with the @ref plugin_callbacks symbol. List the signals
 *     you want to listen to and create the appropiate signal callbacks for each signal.
 *     The callback array is read @a after plugin_init() has been called.
 *  -# Use plugin_signal_connect(), which can be called at any time and can also connect
 *     to non-Geany signals (such as GTK widget signals).
 *
 *  This page lists the signal prototypes, but you connect to them using the
 *  string name (which by convention uses @c - hyphens instead of @c _ underscores).
 *
 *  E.g. @c "document-open" for @ref document_open.
 *
 *  The following code demonstrates how to use signals in Geany plugins. The code can be inserted
 *  in your plugin code at any desired position.
 *
 *  @code
static void on_document_open(GObject *obj, GeanyDocument *doc, gpointer user_data)
{
	printf("Example: %s was opened\n", DOC_FILENAME(doc));
}

PluginCallback plugin_callbacks[] =
{
	{ "document-open", (GCallback) &on_document_open, FALSE, NULL },
	{ NULL, NULL, FALSE, NULL }
};
 *  @endcode
 *  @note The PluginCallback array has to be ended with a final @c NULL entry.

 *  A detailed description of possible notifications and the SCNotification can be found at
 *  http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html#Notifications.
 *
 *  If you connect to this signal, you must check @c nt->nmhdr.code for the notification type
 *  to prevent handling unwanted notifications. This is important because for instance SCN_UPDATEUI
 *  is sent very often whereas you probably don't want to handle this notification.
 *
 *  By default, the signal is sent before Geany's default handler is processing the event.
 *  Your callback function should return FALSE to allow Geany processing the event as well. If you
 *  want to prevent this for some reason, return TRUE.
 *  Please use this with care as it can break basic functionality of Geany.
 *
 *  The signal can be sent after Geany's default handler has been run when you set
 *  PluginCallback::after field to TRUE.
 *
 *  An example callback implemention of this signal can be found in the Demo plugin.
 *
 *  @warning This signal has much power and should be used carefully. You should especially
 *           care about the return value; make sure to return TRUE only if it is necessary
 *           and in the correct situations.
 *
 *  @param obj a GeanyObject instance, should be ignored.
 *  @param editor The current GeanyEditor.
 *  @param nt A pointer to the SCNotification struct which holds additional information for
 *            the event.
 *  @param user_data user data.
 *  @return @c TRUE to stop other handlers from being invoked for the event.
 * 	    @c FALSE to propagate the event further.
 *
 *  @since 0.16
