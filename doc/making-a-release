Let mailing lists know about the coming release.
For major releases:
* Agree string freeze period for translations.
* Try to synchronize release date with geany-plugins.

Update NEWS file - ideally each committer should review their changes 
and summarize the interesting ones.  Use `git log --author='name'`
to filter commits by a particular developer name.

Ensure version numbers are all updated in:
	configure.ac geany.nsi geany_private.rc win32-config.h wscript
	doc/geany.txt
Ensure release date is updated in:
	NEWS doc/geany.txt doc/geany.1.in
Regenerate doc/geany.html.
Check GEANY_CODENAME is set in src/geany.h.

Export the code into a new directory (i.e. not usual working copy).
Run 'make distcheck'.
Delete the created archive and run 'make dist' and 'make dist-bzip2'.
Sign the archives with 'make sign'.

Put the resulting tarballs and signature files on geany.org - upload
to home directory and after the upload is finished move them into
/srv/www/download.geany.org/.
Rename LATEST-IS-... to the new version number in
/srv/www/download.geany.org/ and /srv/www/www.geany.org/files.
Make sure the public part of the GPG key used to sign the archives
can be found on the download page.

Windows builds (enrico?).

Create a signed tag for the release in Git with 'git tag -s <version>'.

Website: update Releases, Documentation links and add a News item.
Update the manual data and links in the filesystem in
/srv/www/www.geany.org/manual.  Remember to update current/hacking.html
too.

Announce on geany, devel, i18n mailing lists (check you're subscribed).
Put a news item on SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/news/?group_id=153444)
and a new release on freecode.com (https://freecode.com/projects/geany).

For non-master releases, merge NEWS into master and any branch-only
commits that need to merged.

For merge releases, bump version strings and codename and merge unstable
branch if any.
