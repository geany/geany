Let mailing lists know about the coming release.
For major releases:
* Agree string freeze period for translations.
* Try to synchronize release date with geany-plugins.

If not updated during the release cycle, copy the latest versions themes from
geany-themes to Geany source tree using scripts/update-themes.py.

Update NEWS file - ideally each committer should review their changes
and summarize the interesting ones.  Use `git log --author='name'`
to filter commits by a particular developer name.

Ensure version numbers are all updated in:
	configure.ac meson.build geany_private.rc geany.exe.manifest doc/geany.txt
Ensure release date is updated in (use scripts/set-release-date if not):
	NEWS doc/geany.txt doc/geany.1.in
Check GEANY_CODENAME is set in src/geany.h.

Export the code into a new directory (i.e. not usual working copy).
Run 'make distcheck'.
Delete the created archive and run 'make dist' and 'make dist-bzip2'.
Sign the archives with 'make sign'.

Upload the resulting tarballs and signature files to your home directory on
geany.org.  Use the script /home/geany/publish-release, passing it the new
version number (e.g. `/home/geany/publish-release 1.36`).
Make sure the public part of the GPG key used to sign the archives
can be found on the download page.

Windows builds are created mostly by Enrico following the instructions on
https://wiki.geany.org/howtos/win32/msys2.

Create a signed tag for the release in Git with 'git tag -s <version>'.

Website: update Latest Version (https://www.geany.org/admin/latest_version/latestversion/)
and add a News item.  Release notes and front page version will be updated
immediately automatically.
If anything seems still outdated, it might be cached. Try to clear the cache using the
big button on https://www.geany.org/admin/clearcache/.

Announce on geany, devel, i18n mailing lists (check you're subscribed).
Put a news item on SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/p/geany/news/)
and a new release on GitHub (https://github.com/geany/geany/releases --
use scripts/github-news to generate the contents).

Update the topic on the Matrix channel.

For non-master releases, merge NEWS into master and any branch-only
commits that need to merged.

For merge releases, bump version strings and codename (use scripts/version-bump,
e.g. `scripts/version-bump 1.37 Wolbam`) and merge unstable branch if any.
